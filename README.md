IoT Data Collection and Sharing Network

In this assignment, you will
have the opportunity to implement your own version of a data collection and sharing network based
on the idea of IoT. Your application is based on the client-server architecture consisting of one server
and multiple clients (i.e., the edge IoT devices) communicating concurrently as well as peer-to-peer
networks. Your application will support a range of functions that are typically found from the existing
edge networks including authentication (between edge devices and the central server), data generation
at the side of edge devices, and data sharing between edge devices and the central server, and between
one edge device and another edge device. You will be designing custom communication protocols
for the edge network based on TCP and UDP.

The first part, which is
covered in Sections 3.2 â€“ 3.3, involves the basic interactions between the edge device (i.e., the client)
and the central server and includes functionality for edge devices to communicate with the central
server via TCP. The second part, covered in Section 3.4, asks you to implement additional functionality
whereby two edge devices can exchange video files with one another directly in a peer-to-peer fashion
via UDP.
